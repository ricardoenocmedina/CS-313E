### **Description of Project:**

---

My project is designed to help you win at the popular New York Times Game *Wordle* with increased accuracy and with way less effort. When you run the code you are first greeted with a welcoming message and a question asking you to select 6 services. 

You can either: 
1. Find five-letter words based on a given prefix (i.e. prefix from 1-4 letters); 
2. Find viable five-letter having specified a letter in a specific position; 
3. Find words that contain a specific letter; 
4. Find words that do NOT contain a specific letter; 
5. Print out a list of potential words that is exported as a separate text file for the user to use; 
6. Exit game

This code uses tries (trees with character nodes) as well as depth-first search algorithms, recursion, and linear search, to make the script possible.
